        <p>Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or team<br> who outlined the technology in a 2008 white paper.
           It's an appealingly simple<br> concept: bitcoin is digital money that allows for secure peer-to-peer <br>transactions on the internet.</p>

        <p class="margin">BTC is the abbreviation for bitcoin.</p>
        <p class="margin"><b>Is Bitcoin cryptocurrency?</b></p>
        <p class="margin">Yes, bitcoin is the first widely adopted cryptocurrency, which <br>is just another way of saying digital money.</p>
        <p class="margin"><b>Is there a simple bitcoin definition?</b></p>

        <p class="margin"><b>At what price did Bitcoin start?</b></p>
        <p class="margin">One BTC was valued at a fraction of a U.S. penny in early 2010. During the <br>
            first quarter of 2011, it exceeded a dollar. In late 2017, its value skyrocketed, topping <br>
            out at close to $20,000. You can track the price of bitcoin <a href="#"> here. </a></p>

        <h2 class="textheading">Bitcoin Basics</h2>
                <p>Since Bitcoin's creation, thousands of new cryptocurrencies have been<br> 
                launched, but bitcoin (abbreviated as BTC) remains the largest by market<br> capitalization and trading volume.</p>
            <ul class="design v">
                <li class="para"><b>Depending on your goals, bitcoin can function as</li>
                <p >- an investment vehicle<br>- a store of value similar to gold <br>- a way to transfer value around the world<br>- even just a way to explore an emerging technology</p>
                <li class="para"><b>Bitcoin is a currency native to the Internet.</b> Unlike<br> government-issued currencies such as the dollar or euro,
                <br> Bitcoin allows online transfers without a middleman such as a<br> bank or payment processor. The removal of those gatekeepers <br> 
                creates a whole range of new possibilities, including the<br> potential for money to move around the global internet more<br> 
                quickly and cheaply, and allowing individuals to have maximum <br>control over their own assets.</li>
                <li class="para">Bitcoin is legal to use, hold, and trade, and can be spent on<br> everything from travel to charitable donations. It's accepted as<br>
                payment by businesses including Microsoft and Expedia.</li>

            </ul>
            <div id="Who-created-bitcoin"></div>
                <h2 class="textheading">Who created bitcoin?</h2>
                <p>To really grasp how bitcoin works, it helps to start at the beginning. The<br> question of who created bitcoin is a fascinating one, because a decade<br>
                 after inventing the technology—and despite a lot of digging by journalists<br> and members of the crypto community—its creator remains anonymous.</p>
                 <ul >
                     <li class="para"><b>The principles behind Bitcoin first appeared in a white paper published<br> online in late 2008</b> by a person or group going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.</li>
                     <li class="para">This paper wasn't the first idea for digital money drawing on the fields of<br> cryptography and computer science—in fact, the paper referred to earlier<br> 
                        concepts—but<b> it was a uniquely elegant solution to the problem of<br> establishing trust between different online entities</b>, where people may<br> be hidden (like bitcoin's own creator)
                         by pseudonyms, or physically<br> located on the other side of the planet.</li>
                      <li class="para"><b>Nakamoto devised a pair of intertwined concepts</b>: the bitcoin private key<br> and the blockchain ledger. When you hold bitcoin, you control it through a <br>
                        private key—a string of randomized numbers and letters that unlocks a<br> virtual vault containing your purchase. Each private key is tracked on the<br> virtual ledger called the blockchain.</li>   
                 </ul>
                 <p><b>When Bitcoin first appeared, it marked a major advance in computer<br> science</b>, because it solved a fundamental problem of commerce on the<br> internet: how do you transfer value between two people without a trusted <br>
                    intermediary (like a bank) in the middle? By solving that problem, the<br> invention of bitcoin has wide-ranging ramifications: As a currency designed<br> for the internet, it allows for financial transactions that range across<br> 
                    borders and around the globe without the involvement of banks, credit-<br>card companies, lenders, or even governments. When any two people—<br>wherever they might live—can send payments to each other without<br> 
                    encountering those gatekeepers, it creates the potential for an open<br> financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative.<br> That, in a nutshell, is bitcoin explained.</p>
                <div id="How-Bitcoin-works"></div>
                <h1 class="textheading">How Bitcoin works</h1>
                  <p>Unlike credit card networks like Visa and payment processors like Paypal,<br> bitcoin is not owned by an individual or company. Bitcoin is the world's first<br> completely open payment network which anyone with an internet<br> 
                   connection can participate in. Bitcoin was designed to be used on the <br>internet, and doesn't depend on banks or private companies to process<br> transactions.</p>
                  <p>One of the most important elements of Bitcoin is the blockchain, which <br>tracks who owns what, similar to how a bank tracks assets. What sets the<br> 
                    Bitcoin blockchain apart from a bank's ledger is that it is decentralized,<br> meaning anyone can view it and no single entity controls it.</p>
                   <p>Here are some details about how it all works:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="para"><b>Specialized computers known as 'mining rigs' perform the equations<br> required to verify and record a new transaction.</b> In the early days, a<br> typical desktop PC was powerful enough to participate, which allowed<br>
                    pretty much anyone who was curious to try their hand at mining. These <br>days the computers required are massive, specialized, and often owned <br>by businesses or large numbers of individuals pooling their resources. (In<br>
                    October 2019, it required 12 trillion times more computing power to mine<br> one bitcoin than it did when Nakamoto mined the first blocks in January<br> 2009.)</li>
                    <li class="para"><b>The miners' collective computing power is used to ensure the accuracy<br> of the ever-growing ledger.</b> Bitcoin is inextricably tied to the blockchain;<br> each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with<br> all existing coins.</li>
                    <li class="para"> <b>How does the network motivate miners to participate in the constant,<br> essential work of maintaining the blockchain—verifying transactions?<br></b> The Bitcoin network holds a continuous lottery in which all the mining<br>
                    rigs around the world race to be the first to solve a math problem. Every<br> 10 min or so, a winner is found, and the winner updates the Bitcoin ledger<br> with new valid transactions. The prize changes over time, but as of early<br> 2020, each winner of this raffle was awarded 12.5 bitcoin.</li>
                    <li class="para">At the beginning, a bitcoin was technically worthless. As of the end of<br> 2019, it was trading at around $7,500.<b> As bitcoin's value has risen, its easy<br> divisibility (the ability to buy a small fraction of one bitcoin) has<br> become a key attribute.</b> 
                    One bitcoin is currently divisible to eight decimal<br> places (100 millionths of one bitcoin); the bitcoin community refers to the<br> smallest unit as a 'Satoshi.'</li>
                    <li class="para"><b>Nakamoto set the network up so that the number of bitcoin will never<br> exceed 21 million, ensuring scarcity</b>. There are currently around 3 million<br> bitcoin still available to be mined, which will happen more and more<br> slowly. The last blocks will theoretically be mined in 2140.</li>

               <div> <p >The easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Trading Platform. Trading Platform makes it easy to buy, sell, send, receive, and store bitcoin without needing to hold it yourself using something called public and private keys.</p></div> 
                <p>However, if you choose to buy and store bitcoin outside of an online<br> exchange, here's how that works.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="para">Each person who joins the bitcoin network is issued a <b>public key</b>, which<br> is a long string of letters and numbers that you can think of like an<br> email address, and a private key, which is equivalent to a password.</li>
                    <li class="para">When you buy bitcoin—or send/receive it—you get a public key, which<br> you can think of as a key that unlocks a virtual vault and gives you <br>access to your money.</li>
                    <li class="para">Anyone can send bitcoin to you via your public key, but only the holder<br> of the private key can access the bitcoin in the “virtual vault” once it's <br>been sent.</li>
                    <li class="para">There are many ways to store bitcoin both online and off. <b>The simplest<br> solution is a virtual wallet</li>
                    <li class="para">If you want to transfer money from your wallet to a bank account after<br> selling your bitcoin,<b> the trading platform app makes it as easy as transferring<br> funds from one bank to another</b>. Similar to conventional bank<br> transfers or ATM withdrawals, exchanges like trading platform
                    set a daily limit,<br> and it may take between a few days and a week for the transaction to<br> be completed.</li>

                <h2 class="textheading">How to use Bitcoin</h2>
                <p>Back in 2013, a bitcoin enthusiast named Laszlo Hanyecz created a<br> message-board post offering 10,000 BTC - which then was worth around<br> $25 - to anyone who would deliver two pizzas to his Jacksonville, Florida,<br> home. As the legend goes, those two pizzas, which another bitcoin early-<br>
                adopter bought from a local Papa John's, marked the first successful <br>purchase of non-virtual goods using bitcoin. Thankfully it's a lot easier to<br> use bitcoin these days!</p>
                <ul class="design">
                    <li class="para"><b>It's private:</b> One of the benefits of paying with bitcoin is that doing so<br> limits the amount of personal information you need to provide. The only<br> time you need to share your name and address is if you're purchasing<br>physical goods that need to be shipped.</li>
                    <li class="para"><b>It's flexible</b>: As to what you should do with your bitcoin, that depends<br> completely on your personal interests. Here are some ideas:</li>

                <h2 class="textheading">Where does Bitcoin come from? </h2>
                <p>Bitcoin is virtually 'mined' by a vast, decentralized (also referred to as 'peer-to<br>-peer') network of computers that are constantly verifying and securing<br> the accuracy of the blockchain. Every single bitcoin transaction is reflected<br>
                 on that ledger, with new information periodically gathered together in a<br> “block,” which is added to all the blocks that came before.</p>
